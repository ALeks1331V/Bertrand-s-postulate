# Bertrand-s-postulate
Homework on the discipline "High-level programming languages"

The formulation of the task from the task book:

Bertrand's postulate (Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem, Chebyshev's theorem) states that for any n ≥ 2 there is a prime number p in the range n < p < 2p. 
Such a hypothesis was put forward in 1845 by the French mathematician Jose Bertrand (who tested it to n = 3-10 °) and proved in 1850 by Paphnutiy Chebyshev. 
Ramanujan found a simpler proof in 1920, and Erdos found an even simpler one in 1932. You have to solve a somewhat more general problem - namely, by the 
number n, find the number of primes p from the interval n < p < 2p. Recall that a natural number is called prime if it is divisible only by itself and by one. 
One is not considered a prime number.
The format of the input data. The input file contains the value of the number n (2 ≤ n ≤
10^6). (First line in file.txt)
Output data format. The output file contains the required number of prime numbers (second line in file.txt).
